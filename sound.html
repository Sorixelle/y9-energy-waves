    <h1>Sound Waves</h1>
    <h5>What is the difference between sound and electromagnatic waves?</h5>
    <p>Sound waves require a medium such as air to travel through, whereas
      electromagnetic waves do not. Sound waves are longitudinal, or compression
      waves, and electromagnetic waves are transverse. Sound waves also travel
      slower then electromagnetic waves, which are at their fastest in a vacuum.</p>

    <h5>What is a cochlear implant?</h5>
    <img align="right" class="responsive-img" src="img/cochlear_implant.jpg">
    <p>A cochlear implant is a device that essentially replaces the inner ear.
      They do what the inner ear normally would to be able to provide sound
      signals to the brain. They are different from hearing aids which only
      amplify sounds. The cochlear implant benefits people who have moderate to
      profound hearing loss on one or both ears.</p>

    <h5>How do the following careers need an understanding of sound?</h5>
    <b>Audiologist</b>
    <p>Audiologists specialise in identifying and treating hearing problems.
      They need to be able to diagnose hearing problems accurately and help
      treat patients with hearing problems, which is where they apply their
      understanding of sound.</p>
    <b>Accoustic Engineer</b>
    <p>Accoustic engineers deal with design and control of sound. They design
      structures or rooms that control sound in a way needed for the structure's
      purpose. An understanding of how sound works is needed to know how to
      build structures that control it.</p>
    <b>Audio Engineer</b>
    <p>
      Audio engineers work on recording, manipulation and reproduction of sound.
      They need an understanding of how sound works so they can set up all the
      recording hardware and software they need to be able to record sounds like
      songs or TV shows at a very high quality.</p>
