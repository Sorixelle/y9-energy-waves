    <h1>Wireless Communication</h1>
    <p>
      Australia has many remote outback areas, where some people live. Usually they are far away
      from the nearest town, and communication with other people is difficult. However, wireless
      communication is a big help to these people, as it gives them access to quick and easy
      communication with not only people in their area, but people around the world. Technology such
      as microwaves, optical fibres, and even satellites in space have all made global wireless
      communication possible.

      Many wireless signals can be transmitted over microwaves. These microwaves have the ability
      to carry multiple electrical signals at one time. A transmitter creates the microwaves, which are
      then received by a device that can receive them, and the device interprets them waves into the
      intended message. However, the microwaves have a limited distance, and as such, they need
      to have their signal strength increased through repetition. Repeater towers accept the
      microwaves coming to it, and transmit them again to increase the distance they can be sent,
      acting as relays for the microwaves. The repeater towers need to be within sight of each other,
      because microwaves travel in one straight direction, like light does. For this reason, repeater
      towers are usually built on a hill, to maximize the amount of microwaves they receive. Due to
      the limited line of sight of microwaves, they are not very practical for long distances, such as
      interstate or international communication.

      <img align="right" src="img/coaxial_cable.jpg">
      Coaxial cables can be used to transfer data as pulses of electricity, rather then electromagnetic
      waves. The signals are carried through thin conductive wires inside tubes, held in place by a
      plastic insulating disc. Most coaxial cables in Australia contain four, six or twelve cables. The
      cables are laid either underground or on the ocean floor. Coaxial cables are able to carry many
      more types of signals simultaneously, such as phone calls and television signals. The way they
      transfer signals make them more effective than microwaves for long distance communication,
      as there are no obstructions to the electric signals. However, the signals do need to be repeated
      like microwaves do. This ensures that the cable’s signal strength is always strong enough to
      reach it’s destination. Repeater stations are needed more frequently than microwave repeaters,
      however, which can limit their range. They can be used is a range similar to those of
      microwaves, due to their similarities in function.

      <img align="left" src="img/optical_fibre.jpg" style="padding-right: 20px;">
      Optical fibre cables are currently the most efficient way of transmitting large quantities of signals
      over long distances. Optical fibres are able to maintain 30,000 signals at once, because of the
      way it transmits it’s information - light. This makes optical fibres extremely fast, as messages are
      being transmitted at the speed of light. The light travels through the optical fibre, which can
      manipulate the light to bend and change it’s direction. Using light for communication was not
      feasible until 1958, with the invention of the laser. Laser is an acronym for “Light Amplification by
      Stimulated Emission of Radiation”. Lasers produce intense light beams of a single colour, that
      travel through these optical fibres for long distances. Light signals also need to be repeated
      every 35-55km to maintain the light’s strength, as the glass in optical fibres absorbs some
      energy from the light. Lasers lose energy slower then ordinary light, as lasers are focused and
      spread out very little, unlike normal light. The cables are much smaller, lighter and more flexible
      than traditional coaxial cables, making them a far superior vector is transmission than coaxial
      cables.

      <img align="right" src="img/satellite.jpg">
      Satellites orbiting the Earth allow for transmitting signals over intercontinental distances at the
      speed of light. They can be used to transmit radio, television or phone signals to remote areas.
      Signals are sent to satellites in geostationary orbit around the Earth. The signals are then sent
      to their intended destination, or to another satellite to send the signal over a longer distance. All
      the energy needed to transmit and amplify the signals comes from solar panels that use the light
      from the Sun to create energy. Geostationary satellites orbit the Earth once every 24 hours, so
      they maintain the same position above the Earth at all times. The satellite needs to be located
      around 36,000km above the equator to maintain the speed necessary for geostationary orbit.
      Tracking station on Earth use radio waves to monitor the satellites and keep them in
      geostationary orbit using small rocket on the satellite. GPS systems use satellites to track the
      position of a GPS-enabled device.

      Wireless communication has come a very long way, to the point where we can transmit signals
      worldwide. Microwaves and coaxial cables are great for transmitting information in a relatively
      local range, while optical fibres and satellites are more optimal for longer distances. All of these
      technologies enable people from all over the world in remote areas communicate with each
      other easily and quickly.
