    <h5>How is infrared radiation used in remote controls?</h5>
    <img align="right" class="responsive-img" src="img/infrared_light.png">
    <p>When you push a button on your remote control the infrared LED on the
      front of your remote starts flashing on and off rapidly. Because humans
      can't see infrared light, we don't see it happen. The appliance then
      detects that light with an infrared reciever, and performs the action the
      button is mapped to. But how does the appliance know what button was
      pressed, or if the signal was directed at it? The infrared light flashes
      have this information. There are many different protocols of infrared
      light transmission, but the SIRC (Sony Infrared Light Code) is one of the
      most widely used. The signal begins with a longer "start" pulse, which
      signifies that the signal is the beginning of a command. After that, the
      light pulses on and off, representng binary digits. The amount of time
      the light is on for determines if the pulse is a 1 or 0; a pulse
      representing 1 is 2 times longer than one representing 0. After the
      command, an address is sent, which tells the appliance what device
      the signal was meant for.</p>

    <h5>How does radiation therapy treat cancer?</h5>
    <p>Radiation therapy uses high-energy waves such as x-rays, gamma rays and
      charged particles to kill cancer cells. The waves kill cancer cells by
      damaging the DNA in the cells or creating charged particles in the cell,
      which in turn damages the cell's DNA. If the cell's DNA is damaged beyond
      repair, the cell becomes unable to divide into new cells, and dies. The
      cells are then broken down and eliminated by the body's natural processes.
      Radiation therapy can kill normal cells along with cancer cells, so side
      effects may occur. This is why doctors take time to plan a radiation
      therapy treatment for a patient.</p>

    <h5>Why does a swimmer's leg look distorted underwater?</h5>
    <img align="right" class="responsive-img" src="img/refraction_pool.jpg">
    <p>A swimmer's leg is distorted underwater because of refraction. Refraction
      occurs when light is travelling from one medium from another; in this
      example, light is travelling from air to water. Because water is denser
      than air, light slows down in the water. This causes the light to change
      direction. Because the light is travelling in a divverent direction, it
      reaches the eye in a different direction as well, causing the swimmer's
      leg to appear distorted and not in the place it actually is.</p>

    <h5>How was the bionic eye developed?</h5>
    <p>The bionic eye is a device that allows blind people to see. It works by
      using a camera attached to a pair of glasses that transmits radio signals
      at a high frequency to a microchip implanted in the eye. The microchip
      converts the signals into electrical impulses that stimulate the retina
      and pass the signals to the brain. The bionic eye benefits people with
      retinis pigmentosa (loss of photoreceptor cells and peripheral vision) and
      macular degeneration, which causes cells in the retina to stop converting
      light into signals, leaving the afflicted person unable to form a complete
      image.</p>
